ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,I.
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,NA
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,memory.
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,NA
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still,"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,my former friend and companion.
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,NA
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers."
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,had formerly been in part my own.
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,NA
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,introspective fashion.
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,NA
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"""Wedlock suits you,"" he remarked. ""I think, Watson, that you have"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."""

ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"""Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more,"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"tell me that you intended to go into harness."""
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,NA
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"""Then, how do you know?"""
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,NA
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"""I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"careless servant girl?"""
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,NA
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"""My dear Holmes,"" said I, ""this is too much. You would certainly"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it"

ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a"

ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"him to be an active member of the medical profession."""
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,NA
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"process of deduction. ""When I hear you give your reasons,"" I"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"remarked, ""the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"as yours."""
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,NA
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"""Quite so,"" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"himself down into an armchair. ""You see, but you do not observe."
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."""

ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"""Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"interested in these little problems, and since you are good"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"may be interested in this."" He threw over a sheet of thick,"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.

ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with"
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence"

ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA,"of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to"

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for"

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,NA

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real"

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back"

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,NA
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"""There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that"

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he"

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward,"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and,"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us."
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding"

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all"

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,NA
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"""I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!"" said Holmes"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"severely. ""You have already imperilled the whole success of our"

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,and put his glass in his pocket.

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked"

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,of a light.
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,NA
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,the stones.
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,NA
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,"

ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,"waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another"
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE,instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after

ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long

ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,NA
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and

ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds

ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking"

ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then"
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,"highroad, where all traces were lost."
ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY,NA

ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a

ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or"

ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key,"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small"

ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever,"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man,"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by"

ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who"

ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,'American Encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you.
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,considering the formidable letters which were received by himself
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"letters?"""
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,NA
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"""The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"third from London."""
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,NA
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"""From East London. What do you deduce from that?"""
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,NA
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"""They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."""
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,NA
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"""Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days."
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"Does that suggest anything?"""

ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way

ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the"
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,of the efforts of the United States government and of the better
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS,"classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year"

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town"

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,you found me to-night--and running through the front room she
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who"

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of"

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,"

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,swore that no one else had been in the front room during the
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill,"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St."
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of"

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,NA
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"""And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,could not account in any way for the presence of the missing

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which"

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he"

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face"
ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP,"disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has"

VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,next day.
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,NA

VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,come either from the window or the door. My attention was
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned."
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but"
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,sooner or later she must fall a victim.
VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,NA

VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the

VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND,"Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in"

X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your

X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,"fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting,"
X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek

X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,"my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was"

X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I
X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,"didn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the"
X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my

X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,"a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to"
X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,"know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to"
X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,"tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,"
X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on
X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,"the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the"
X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a

X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR,Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of

XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it."
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,corner of the building.

XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest

XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should"

XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"""The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr.
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"along the entire front of the house, with three long windows"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs."
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,the nursery.
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,NA
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"""Two days later this same performance was gone through under"

XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"stories of which my employer had an immense repertoire, and which"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,to change my dress.
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,NA
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"""You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.

XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp

XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.

XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"""And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,NA
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"""I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,locked.
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,NA
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"""I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked."
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"his face which made him a very different person to the round,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,without a word or a look.
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,NA
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"""This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever."
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,NA
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"""'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,business matters.'
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,NA
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"""I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one"

XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"annoyance, but no jest."
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,NA
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"""Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,forbidden door.
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,NA
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"""It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"opened the door, and slipped through."
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,NA
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"""There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end."
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting"

XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of

XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,"in the household who had any influence with the savage creature,"
XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES,or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and
